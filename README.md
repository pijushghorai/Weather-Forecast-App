# Weather-Forecast-App
## Description

I recently created a dynamic weather application using JavaScript, integrating two APIs to enhance the user experience. The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data based on user location input and the Unsplash API to dynamically change the background image of the application based on the weather condition.

## Key Features

- Real-time weather updates based on user input.
- Dynamic background images that change according to the weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
- User-friendly interface with clear weather information display.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript for application logic.
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
- Unsplash API for dynamic background images.
- HTML/CSS for layout and styling.
